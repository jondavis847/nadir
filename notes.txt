On diff_eq:

Rather than use a general diffeq solver, we decided to implement directly in multibody.
For example, if it was general, we'd have to calculate the transforms every stage of the solver,
but since the initial state doesnt change, the transforms don't change, so we only need to 
calculate once for the whole rk4 time step.
